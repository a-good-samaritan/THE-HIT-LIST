HIT LIST is a conceptual idea of an anonymous bounty hunt program for entities that pose a threat to the society ; be it any person , organization , organized crime syndicate , any organization that has links to animal cruelty or any form of social injustice.
The goal of this program will be collecting all the evidence of those entities and placing them into the bounty hunt program , depending on the severity of the situation , appropriate measures can be taken 

How the bounty hunt program will work ? 
The users , in this sense the genral public has the power to intiate a bounty on entities that are deemed unfit for this world

What will the bounty hunt do 
Depending on the severity of the issue steps can be taken in the following ways 
1. Alert the respected authorities of such misconduct 
2. If the authorities don't take any action then volunteers can initiate a protest 
3. If the protest fails then the last option is for the complete termination of those entities , either by exposing them , ending their businesses or by killing them 

Will the volunteer do this for free
No the volunteers will be paid for in cryptocurrency by none other than the general public

Ins't the system biased 
In order to tackle this situation , the program will have two phases 
1. Review phase 
2. Execution phase 

Review phase 
The reviws phase will consist of a voting system , in which the enitites in the top 50 will be shifted to the execution phase 
So its's in the solemn hands of the general public to give a non biased opinion on the entity they are voting for elimination 

Exection phase 
After all the reviews and fact checking the plan will go as scheduled , volunteers who come up for the exection will be rewarded by the genral public for their heroic action 

Every person is anonymous here  , no one is going to judge you here 

Challenges 
1. The awarding system for the volunteers 
2. Evading government scrutiny 
3. Validating the volunteers work , if they have executed the plan successfully
